== CROWDCAST

Put any todo for iteration 1 here so we know what tasks need to be
finished before the deadline:


-Figure out how to save/display images (REPLACED WITH A MAP API, IMAGES LATER -Jhoong)

- When logged in, hide the login / signup buttons -- I can do this for the main page, but somehow needs to make it stay for all the headers when you click around (it reappears...)
