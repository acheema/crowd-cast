== CROWDCAST

Put any todo for iteration 1 here so we know what tasks need to be
finished before the deadline:

-Add listing table in the schema, manually test the add listing
	functionality (with owner/listing association) so it saves
	a listing in the database and displays properly

-Figure out how to save/display images
	(useful gem for this is "paperclip")

- When logged in, hide the login / signup buttons -- I can do this for the main page, but somehow needs to make it stay for all the headers when you click around (it reappears...)
- successful login? succesful signup? redirect to right page
- show error messages for incorrect sign up (currently login functionality 80% done)
