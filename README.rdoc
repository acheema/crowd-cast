== CROWDCAST

Put any todo for iteration 1 here so we know what tasks need to be
finished before the deadline:

-Add listing table in the schema, manually test the add listing
	functionality (with owner/listing association) so it saves
	a listing in the database and displays properly
	
-Figure out how to save/display images
	(useful gem for this is "paperclip")
